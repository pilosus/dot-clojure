# personal `~/.clojure`

Inspired by Sean Corfield's
[dot-clojure](https://github.com/seancorfield/dot-clojure) and
[Practicalli Clojure CLI
Configuration](https://github.com/practicalli/clojure-cli-config).

Intended to be a separate repo used as a `git-submodule` with my
private [GNU/stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html)
repo.
